# Platform - GitHub

This is a central repository for GitHub actions and workflows for applications deploying on Kubernetes. As of the writing, only deployment
on [Digital Ocean's Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes) is supported, but we are planning to add support
for deploying on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as well.

## Requirements

- Digital Ocean account
- Kubernetes Cluster on Digital Ocean
- Docker repository
- DNS Account
- Doppler (For configuration management - Optional)
- SonarQube (For running code analysis - Optional)

## Account on Digital Ocean

- We will be needing API access token in order to interact with the resources on Digital Ocean
- Learn about to create a personal access token [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/). Token needs to have both `read` and `write` scope.
- Take a note of the created **API token**. We will be needing this for rest of the setup.

## Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster

- Creating Kubernetes cluster via Digital Ocean console
    - Learn about how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/quickstart/).
    - Take a note of the created **cluster's ID**. We will be needing this for rest of the setup.
- Install `kubectl`
    - Command line tool to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. Learn on how to install it locally [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
    - To check if successfully installed, run - `kubectl version`
- Install `doctl`
    - Command line tool to interact with resources on Digital Ocean. We need this to authenticate our `kubectl` client with our Kubernetes cluster.
    - Learn on how to install it locally [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/).
    - After following the process, make sure following runs successfully - `doctl account get`
- Connect to cluster
    - Run - `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <cluster_id>`
    - To verify - `kubectl config current-context` should print out `do-<cluster_region>-<cluster_name>`
- Install `helm`
    - Helm is a package manager which allows us to install third-party packages on our Kubernetes cluster.
    - Learn on how to install is locally [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Install using `helm` - Nginx Ingress
    - `helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx`
    - `helm repo update`
    - `helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.publishService.enabled=true`
- Install using `helm` - Cert Manager
    - `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.yaml`
- Get external IP address for your cluster
    - Our cluster is now ready for handling external traffic.
    - To get IP to which DNS entries can be mapped to (A records), run - `kubectl get service nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller -n default`. Note the value in `EXTERNAL-IP` column.

## Setting up Docker repository

- We will be needing a docker repository where images will be pushed from our workflow and pulled in from the cluster for running the applications.
- Workflow supports number of docker registries, to name a few:
    - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
    - [Digital Ocean's Container Registry](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/container-registry)
    - [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)
- This guide only documents setting up and integrating Docker Hub with the Kubernetes cluster.
- After creating a repository on Docker Hub, take a note of the **repository's name**, **account username**, **account password** (can use an access token as well here for more control)

## Setting up DNS

For routing traffic to your cluster, add an `A` record for the cluster's external IP which was obtained from _Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster_ step.

## Setting up Doppler

- For configuration management and securely providing access to the secrets to application, this setup uses [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) which is allows us to inject configuration parameters as environment variables to application runtime.
- As mentioned, this is an optional requirement and is meant only for application which require runtime configuration.
- Learn about creating a doppler project and environments [here](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/create-project)
- Learn about creating a service token in order to access secret associated with an environment [here](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/service-tokens#dashboard-create-service-token)
- Take a note of the **project**, **environment**, and **service token**. We will be needing this for rest of the setup.

## Setting up SonarQube

- This workflow also supports running static analyzer on open PRs and base branch using SonarQube
- Learn more about how to import a GitHub repository into SonarQube [here](https://github.com/jalantechnologies/platform-sonarqube#project-import-process---github)
- Using the steps provided in [If using GitHub actions](https://github.com/jalantechnologies/platform-sonarqube#project-import-process---github), take a note of `SONAR_TOKEN` and `SONAR_HOST_URL`
- No need to follow any remaining steps, workflows here will take care of the rest.

## Workflows

    - Runs sonarqube analyzer against checked in code
    - Requires `sonar_token` and `sonar_host_url` parameters to be set
    - Run default branch analyzer if no `pull_request_number` was provided
    - Runs new code branch analyzer if `pull_request_number` was provided

    - Looks at following directories for specifications:
        - `lib/kube/core` - Core specifications. Meant for one time resources.
        - `lib/kube/shared` - Shared specification. Meant for specifications common amongst environments.
        - `lib/kube/$KUBE_ENV` - Environment specific configuration. Uses value for `app_env` parameter for `$KUBE_ENV`.
    - Supplies following variables which can be referenced as `$VARIABLE` which can be used in specifications:
        - [Environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) provided by GitHub.

        - `DOPPLER_MANAGED_SECRET_NAME` - Kubernetes secret name for doppler which can be referenced in kubernetes specifications (If using doppler)
        - `KUBE_NS` - Kubernetes namespace
        - `KUBE_APP` - Kubernetes application name
        - `KUBE_ENV` - Value provided for `app_env`
        - `KUBE_DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE` - Deployment image
        - `KUBE_INGRESS_HOSTNAME` - Kubernetes ingress hostname

### clean

For tearing up deployments. Destroys kubernetes resources found in:
- `lib/kube/shared`
- `lib/kube/$KUBE_ENV` - Uses value for `app_env` parameter for `$KUBE_ENV`.

**Usage:**

```yaml
name: clean_on_delete

on: delete

    clean:
        # only run when deleting a branch
        if: github.event.ref_type == 'branch'
